# Simultaneous Localization and Clock Calibration

To use this code correctly, please note the following steps:

1. If using `3WB boot loading` and connecting `BTSRC_SEL-VDDD`, after the code download is complete, be sure to disconnect the `BTSRC_SEL-VDDD` jumper cap. Pulling up `BTSRC_SEL` will disable the optical receiver (refer to: `SCuM_3C_User_Guide.pdf`, 7.2 3-Wire Bus Bootloading, P18.)
